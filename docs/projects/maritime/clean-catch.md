# Clean Catch - Government Bycatch Reduction Programme

## Overview

Clean Catch is the UK government's flagship bycatch reduction programme, delivered by Arribada as project lead for a consortium including CEFAS (Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science), ZSL (Zoological Society of London), IOZ (Institute of Zoology), MMO Consulting, and MWC (Marine and Wildlife Consultancy).

**Current Status**: 92.3% complete (documented completion rate)

**Project Focus**: Bycatch reduction within English fishing fleets with confidence improvement in data collection surrounding bycatch monitoring

**Regional Deployment**: Southwest inshore fisheries of Cornwall with planned expansion to other English fisheries

## Project Background

### DEFRA Funding and Governance

Based on documented project information:

> "DEFRA has funded Clean Catch for a further 3 years, Arribada is the current project lead for the programme and its' development for this period."

The programme operates specifically within English waters, as the devolved administrations maintain their own bycatch projects and governance frameworks.

### Consortium Structure

**Primary Partners**:
- **Arribada Initiative**: Project lead and technology development
- **CEFAS**: Fisheries science authority and regulatory compliance
- **ZSL**: Conservation expertise and field validation  
- **IOZ**: Research methodology and data analysis
- **MMO Consulting**: Marine management and stakeholder engagement
- **MWC**: Industry liaison and practical implementation

## Key Technologies

### PAR Technology (Pingers and Acoustic Repellent)

Based on documented development work:

**Acoustic Deterrent Systems**:
- Ultrasonic devices designed to alert cetaceans
- Smart activation based on environmental conditions
- Extended operation capability for long fishing trips
- 25 PAR units currently under evaluation for marine durability

### Insight360 Integration

**Electronic Monitoring Platform**:
- AI/ML-powered video monitoring system developed with CEFAS
- Multi-camera coverage including below water monitoring
- Voice recognition technology for on-deck audio analysis
- Automated compliance documentation and submission

**Hardware Components**:
- NVIDIA Jetson-powered AI processing units
- High-definition camera systems with thermal imaging capability
- Acoustic sensor arrays for underwater sound monitoring
- GPS integration for precise vessel tracking and area documentation

## Implementation Scope

### Geographic Focus

Based on documented deployment:

**Phase 1 (Current)**:
- Southwest inshore fisheries of Cornwall
- Focus on gillnet fishing operations
- Targeted development and testing of Clean Catch app and Insight360 system

**Phase 2 (Planned)**:
- Expansion to other fisheries around England
- Development of relationships and projects within additional fishing communities
- Continued focus on English waters (devolved administrations manage their own programmes)

### Hardware Implementation

**PAR Technology Testing**:
- 25 PAR units currently under evaluation for ruggedness testing
- Acoustic deterrent systems designed for cetacean protection
- Battery-powered operation for extended fishing trips
- Smart activation based on environmental conditions

**Insight360 Integration**:
- NVIDIA Jetson-based AI processing units
- Multi-camera monitoring systems
- Voice recognition technology for audio analysis
- GPS tracking and location documentation

### Software Development

**Frigate CCTV Integration**:
- Open-source video processing platform
- Real-time object detection capabilities
- User interface development for vessel operators
- Automated event classification and logging

**Vessel Monitoring Systems**:
- Real-time fleet positioning and activity monitoring
- Automated catch documentation
- Compliance reporting and data submission
- Integration with CEFAS data collection requirements

## Technical Development

### Data Collection and Monitoring

Based on documented project requirements:

**Electronic Monitoring Focus**:
- Fisher-led approach to cetacean bycatch monitoring
- Primary focus on gillnet fisheries in Southwest UK
- Affordable, scalable, and flexible monitoring solutions
- On-deck voice recognition technology integration
- Advanced machine learning for automated event detection

**System Requirements**:
- Sea trials involving up to 5 vessels from Southwest UK fishing ports
- Sequential system improvements based on field testing
- Below water and advanced above deck monitoring capabilities
- Multiple camera systems with control box integration
- Production enclosure development based on testing feedback

### Haul Sensor Technology

Based on engineering documentation from project discussions:

**RFID Sensor Implementation**:
- Passive RFID sensors placed on rope attachments to surface buoys
- First component to return during hauls triggers automatic camera activation
- Ensures haul events are recorded consistently
- Sensors operate only above water (not functional when submerged)
- Ring net deployment uses "buoy thing" attachment points

**Temperature and Depth Sensors**:
- Environmental monitoring paired with GPS boat data
- Location correlation essential for meaningful data collection
- Integration with vessel positioning for comprehensive monitoring

### Government Compliance Framework

**DEFRA Programme Structure**:
- Multi-year government funding commitment
- Consortium-based delivery model
- Focus on data collection confidence improvement
- Regulatory compliance for English fishing fleets
- Coordination with devolved administration programmes

**Expansion Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Southwest Cornwall inshore fisheries
- Phase 2: Extension to other English fisheries
- Relationship development with additional fishing communities
- Technology refinement based on operational experience
