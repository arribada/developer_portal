# Quality Management at Arribada

Quality is at the heart of everything we do at Arribada. Our devices operate in some of the world's harshest environments - from the depths of the ocean to remote wilderness areas - where failure is not an option.

## Our Quality Approach

We believe that quality isn't just about testing at the end of the development process - it's built into every step of our work, from initial concept through to field deployment and beyond.

### Quality Management System

Our comprehensive quality management system ensures that every product meets the highest standards for reliability, performance, and environmental resilience.

- **[Quality Manual](quality-manual)** - Our overarching quality policies and procedures
- **[Design Review Procedure](design-review-procedure)** - Systematic approach to design validation
- **[Manufacturing QC](manufacturing-qc)** - Quality control in production
- **[Field Deployment](field-deployment)** - Ensuring quality in real-world conditions

### Templates & Tools

We've developed a comprehensive set of templates and tools to support quality processes across all projects:

- **[Concept Review Package](templates/concept-review-package)** - Early-stage project assessment
- **[PDR Checklist](templates/pdr-checklist)** - Preliminary Design Review checklist
- **[CDR Report](templates/cdr-report)** - Critical Design Review documentation
- **[Action Tracker](templates/action-tracker)** - Issue tracking and resolution

## Quality in Practice

Quality at Arribada means:

- **Reliability**: Devices that work when and where they're needed most
- **Durability**: Hardware designed to withstand extreme environmental conditions  
- **Accuracy**: Precise data collection for scientific and conservation applications
- **Consistency**: Repeatable processes that deliver predictable results
- **Compliance**: Meeting all relevant industry standards and regulations
