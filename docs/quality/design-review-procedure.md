# Design Review Procedure

## Purpose
This procedure establishes a systematic approach for conducting design reviews throughout the product development lifecycle, ensuring all requirements are met and risks are identified early.

## Scope
Applies to all hardware, firmware, and software development projects at Arribada Initiative.

## Design Review Gates

### Gate 1: Concept Design Review (CDR)

**Timing:** 2-3 weeks after project kickoff

**Objectives:**
- Validate requirements understanding
- Confirm technical approach feasibility
- Identify major risks and challenges
- Approve concept direction

**Required Documents:**
- Requirements specification
- Concept sketches/block diagrams
- Technology trade-offs analysis
- Preliminary risk assessment
- Budget estimate

**Review Criteria:**
```markdown
