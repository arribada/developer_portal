# Contributing to Arribada

Welcome to the Arribada contributor guide! This guide provides everything you need to know to contribute effectively to our conservation technology platform.

## Our Mission

At Arribada, we're democratising conservation technology by building reusable, open-source solutions that enable researchers and conservation organisations worldwide to track and monitor wildlife effectively.

## Engineering Philosophy

### Build Once, Use Everywhere
We follow a platform-first approach where every solution we create should be:
- **Reusable**: Components should work across multiple projects
- **Modular**: Easy to adapt for different species and environments
- **Documented**: Knowledge captured, not trapped in individual minds
- **Sustainable**: Built to last and maintainable by the community

### Open by Default
- All our technology is open source
- We share knowledge, not just code
- Documentation is as important as implementation
- Community contributions strengthen the platform
