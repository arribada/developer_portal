# Platform Overview

Welcome to the Arribada Platform - the world's leading open-source satellite connectivity platform for conservation technology.

## What is Arribada?

Arribada provides a comprehensive platform for building conservation and environmental monitoring solutions with satellite connectivity. Our platform combines:

- **Hardware**: Ultra-compact 20x20x2mm satellite connectivity modules
- **Firmware**: Zephyr RTOS-based development environment
- **Cloud**: Data processing and dashboard infrastructure  
- **Community**: Open-source ecosystem with commercial support

## Why Choose Arribada?

### 🎯 **Purpose-Built for Conservation**
Unlike generic IoT platforms, Arribada is specifically designed for the unique challenges of environmental monitoring:
- Extreme environmental conditions (marine, arctic, tropical)
- Ultra-low power consumption for years of operation
- Satellite connectivity for remote deployments
- Cost-effective for conservation budgets

### 🏛️ **Government Validated**
Our platform has been validated by multiple government agencies:
- **UK Government**: DEFRA (Clean Catch), CEFAS (Insight 360)
- **EU Space Agency**: €372K ESA contract for MARLIN project
- **International**: UNICEF partnerships for GeoSeals humanitarian aid tracking

### 💰 **Cost Advantage**
Significant cost savings compared to commercial alternatives:
- **26% cost reduction** through platform standardization (£470 → £345 per unit)
- **25-75% cost advantage** over proprietary solutions
- Open-source approach reduces licencing costs

### 🌍 **Proven at Scale**
Deployed globally across multiple conservation projects:
- **Operation Pangolin**: Wildlife tracking (73% complete)
- **GeoSeals**: Humanitarian aid tracking with UNICEF
- **Sea Turtle Tags**: Marine research (78% complete)
- **MARLIN**: Commercial fishing monitoring
