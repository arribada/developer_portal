# Horizon Platform Architecture

> ðŸš§ **Coming Soon** - This architectural guide is currently being developed.

## Overview

Deep dive into the Horizon SMD platform architecture, covering hardware, firmware, and cloud components.

## Core Architecture

### Hardware Layer
- 20x20x2mm modular design
- Multi-protocol connectivity (Argos, LoRa, Cellular)
- Ultra-low power management
- Environmental hardening specifications

### Firmware Layer
- Zephyr RTOS foundation
- Modular driver architecture
- Real-time data processing
- OTA update capabilities

### Connectivity Layer
- Satellite communication protocols
- Mesh networking capabilities
- Edge processing and caching
- Adaptive transmission strategies

### Cloud Layer
- Scalable data ingestion
- Real-time processing pipeline
- Device management system
- API and dashboard services

## Key Design Principles

### Modularity
- Pluggable hardware components
- Configurable firmware modules
- API-driven integrations

### Reliability
- Redundant communication paths
- Fault tolerance and recovery
- Field-proven durability

### Efficiency
- Power optimisation at all layers
- Bandwidth-conscious protocols
- Cost-effective deployment
